Example applications
====================

Simplified examples
-------------------

The repository contains a number of simple examples for building applications
with different frameworks:

- `A console application <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/console>`_
- `A PyQt5 application <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pyqt5>`_

  - `PyQt5 with QML <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pyqt5_qml>`_
  - `PyQt5 with OpenCV <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pyqt5_opencv>`_

- `A PyGI (or PyGObject) application with Numpy and Matplotlib (64 bit, Python 3.4) <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pygi_mpl_numpy>`_
- `A pygame application <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pygame>`_
- `A pyglet application <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pyglet>`_
- `A pywebview application <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples/pywebview>`_

Real-world examples
-------------------

These may illustrate more complex uses of pynsist.

- `Mu <https://codewith.mu/>`_ is a beginner-friendly code editor for Python,
  written with PyQt5.
- The author's own application, `Taxonome <https://bitbucket.org/taxonome/taxonome/src>`_,
  is a Python 3, PyQt4 application for working with scientific names for species.
- `Spreads <https://github.com/jbaiter/spreads/tree/windows>`_ is a book scanning tool,
  including a tkinter configuration system and a local webserver. Its use of
  pynsist (see ``buildmsi.py``) includes working with setuptools info files.
- `InnStereo <https://github.com/tobias47n9e/innsbruck-stereographic>`_ is a GTK 3
  application for geologists. Besides pygi, it uses numpy and matplotlib.
