This is an example that uses binary packages.

To make the installer on a non-Windows system, download the PyQt4 installer from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.10.4/PyQt4-4.10.4-gpl-Py3.3-Qt4.8.5-x32.exe

Open it up with an archive tool, and extract the PyQt4 folder and sip.pyd from
Lib/site-packages. Place them in a folder called pynsist_pkgs, and pynsist will
use them in preference to the files it finds on your system.

The '#!python3.3' line is used by the Python Windows launcher (PEP 397) to
select which version of Python to run. This is important, because binary
packages for Python 3.3 won't work on Python 3.4.
